        <p>The game was introduced to the Calcuttans (then the capital of India) by the British soldiers in the 
          nineteenth century. Very few would know that Nagendra Prasad Sarbadhakari, known as the Father of Indian
           Football forced his classmates into playing the game in his school compound.Walter Camp is credited with 
           altering the rules of rugby to create the game of modern North American football we are familiar with
            today. The line of scrimmage, use of downs, point system, the number of players per side, and the creation
             of the quarterback position all stemmed from Walter Camp's influence.</p>

            twining, onion skin, etc. Marks were awarded for concept, creativity, idea and the maximum use of the
            software.In the Test your Science Quotient contest, several experiments were demonstrated. Students 
            had to answer questions relating to these experiments. Srijoy Mukherjee of class VIII participated and
            he comfortably picked up the second prize. A treasure hunt for students of classes IX to X had also

          parents make the right nutritional choices.each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be
          provided with the school canteen account on the school webdite that keeps the track of their previous meal
          choices and any dietary requirements they may have . ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals

          <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Most Schools and Colleges in India have a
          compulsory Attendance policy. This is linked to the eligibility to appear in exams. Besides, Institutes would like
          Students to attend classes and benefit from the classes. Teachers and Lecturers are given the un-enviable task of
          marking Student Attendance in each period daily- which can be time-consuming as well as tiresome and not very
          productive at all!  Now you can use the Contactless, Face Recognition Device to identify each student attending 
         a class and marking attendance with date and time stamping. This makes the process of Attendance Capturing and
          Analysis automatic and efficient. The RS-HRIS Attendance Management Software manages Student, Staff and 
           Out-sourced workers attendance as per the policies of the Educational Institute. For Students the attendance
            is captured subject-wise & Faculty-wise. The system is designed to send auto-notification and Low-Attendance 
            alerts to Students and Parents, so that informed decisions about their attendance performance can be taken.
             Administrators can track absences, tardiness, etc., providing real-time feedback on their performance and 
             communicating with parents. It can make the Educational Institute make sure students stay focused and keep
           up good grades without any hurdles.</p>
